/**
 * A chess puzzle, hidden behind the most played first move in chess.

 * **Trigger.** `e4`, typed anywhere that is not a text field. The guard is the
 * point: a visitor typing an email address into a form is not summoning a
 * chessboard, so inputs, textareas, selects and anything `contentEditable`
 * are skipped, and a keystroke held with ctrl, cmd or alt is not typing at
 * all — cmd+E then ctrl+4 must not open this. The buffer is only ever two
 * characters long and resets whenever it is fed a key it does not want.
 *
 * **It is not a chess engine.** One position, one scripted answer, and the
 * only legality it knows is the queen's own geometry (`queenCanReach`) so a
 * piece cannot be put where a queen could never go. Everything else the
 * board needs is in lib/chess.ts, which has no DOM in it.
 *
 * **Reduced motion.** The overlay's entrance and the shake are both `motion`
 * animations, which the globals.css block cannot reach, so they are gated
 * here. A refused move under reduced motion is an instant state — the square
 * marks itself, the line below the board says so — rather than the same shake
 * played faster.
 *
 * **The wrapper outlives the board.** `AnimatePresence` holds a removed child
 * in the tree long enough for its exit to play, so the component never
 * returns null: the outer div is always rendered and carries `aria-hidden`
 * while the board is absent. Returning null on close would unmount the
 * wrapper in the same commit as its child and the exit would never run.
