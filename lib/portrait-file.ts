 * The one photograph, for the three surfaces that cannot use a component.
 *
 * `app/icon.tsx`, `app/apple-icon.tsx` and `app/opengraph-image.tsx` are drawn
 * by `next/og`, which renders a small subset of CSS on the server and cannot
 * run React components, canvas, or `next/image`. So the file is read off disk
 * and inlined, and all three read it from here.
 *
 * That last part is the point. The favicon and the share card are the two
 * hardest things on a site to change quietly later, and this portrait is a
 * stand-in taken from LinkedIn pending a real photograph. Deriving all three
 * from one constant means replacing `public/portrait/kenny.png` replaces the
 * tab icon, the home-screen icon and every link preview at once, with nothing
 * else to remember.

 * about fourteen of them and the rest to a wall, a shirt and a framed print —
 * at which size it is a grey smudge, not a person. So the icons take a square
 * window around the head instead: it is the same photograph, cropped to the one
 * part of it that can survive being that small.
 *
 * The window is square so it can be dropped into a square box without the
 * aspect being decided twice.
